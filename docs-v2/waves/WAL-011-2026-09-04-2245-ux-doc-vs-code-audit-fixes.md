— 2026-09-04 22:45 — UX doc-vs-code audit fixes

UX review flagged three doc-vs-code / doc-quality issues. Fixed:

1. **Duplicate `## Section XIX` heading in FINALSUMMARY.md**
   - Second occurrence renamed to `## Section XX — RUN 11.1 (…): LM head audit fixes` so the section sequence is X, XI, …, XVIII, XIX, XX — no more ambiguity.
2. **Stale `(End of file - total ~1280 lines)` annotation at line 1231** (mid-file)
   - Removed. File now ends cleanly at line ~1378 with a single end-of-file anchor.
3. **LmHeadResource.java Javadoc lied about endpoints**
   - Claimed `POST /v1/lm-head/reset — clear all weights` (no such endpoint exists).
   - Did not mention the new `?nNegatives=K` query param (the headline feature of the commit).
   - Fixed: Javadoc now accurately describes `POST /v1/lm-head/train?limit=N&epochs=M&nNegatives=K`
     with each param's default/max documented, plus `GET /v1/lm-head/status`.

No code logic changed; only docs and Javadoc. All targeted tests still green:
- `./gradlew :matrix-core:test --tests "io.matrix.api.*"` → 0 failures, 0 errors across
  LmHeadTest (7), SandboxResourceTest (8), QaCorpusIndexTest (12), BpeTokenizerTest (5),
  OpenAIChatResourceTest (17), and 14 other API test classes.
